## Instructions

* `00_all_opsins/` contains files on the opsin genes present in each of the species. This include fasta files of the opsin protein sequences per species, as well as gff files per species with the location of each opsin in the genome annotated. It also contains code and data required to reproduce plots from Figure 1, including species tree used and opsin copy number per species.
