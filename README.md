## Instructions

* `00_all_opsins/` contains files on the opsin genes present in each of the species. This include fasta files of the opsin protein sequences per species, as well as gff files per species with the location of each opsin in the genome annotated. It also contains `.tsv` files and `hbx_count_heatmap.R` required to reproduce Figure 1 in the manuscript. This directory also contains `expression_results` which has all code and data required to measure expression of homeobox genes in a select number of species.
